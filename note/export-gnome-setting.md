No, there isn't a single, official tool to export **all** GNOME settings in one go. However, you can back up most of your core desktop settings and many application preferences by exporting the `dconf` database.

### Method 1: Exporting the `dconf` Database (Recommended)

Most GNOME settings are stored in a key-value database managed by `dconf`. You can export this database to a file and then load it on your new machine.

#### On Your Old Machine (Export)

Open a terminal and run the following command to dump your entire `dconf` database to a file named `gnome-settings.dconf`.

```bash
dconf dump / > gnome-settings.dconf
```

This will capture all your user-level settings for GNOME, including themes, window behavior, keyboard shortcuts, and many application preferences.

#### On Your New Machine (Import)

Copy the `gnome-settings.dconf` file to your new machine. Make sure you have a fresh GNOME installation, then run this command to load the settings.

```bash
dconf load / < gnome-settings.dconf
```

After this, log out and log back in for the changes to take full effect.

**Important:** This method is best for migrating between the **same versions of the same distribution** (e.g., Fedora 38 to Fedora 38). Importing `dconf` settings between different GNOME or OS versions can cause unexpected issues.

### Method 2: Manual Backup (Most Reliable)

The most robust way to transfer all your settings is to manually back up your key configuration directories. This is more reliable because it includes application-specific config files, themes, and extensions.

#### Key Directories to Back Up

  * **`~/.config`**: Contains configuration files for most desktop applications.
  * **`~/.local/share`**: Contains application data, including installed `desktop` files and some extension data.
  * **`~/.themes`** (if it exists): Contains custom GTK themes.
  * **`~/.icons`** (if it exists): Contains custom icon sets.
  * **`~/.fonts`** (if it exists): Contains custom fonts.

You can create a compressed archive of these directories to easily transfer them:

```bash
tar -czvf my_gnome_config.tar.gz ~/.config ~/.local/share ~/.themes ~/.icons ~/.fonts
```

On your new machine, you would then extract this archive to your home directory.

```bash
tar -xzvf my_gnome_config.tar.gz -C $HOME
```
